##Bark Detector

Simple project to modify the kws20_demo, adding another class for the recognition of a dog's bark.
For the use case in the PH, also add functionality of recognizing the common "TAO PO" phrase.
Will connect to some cloud functionality using the ESP8266.
Also adding network features with an ESP8266 for sending an alert when the bark is detected.
